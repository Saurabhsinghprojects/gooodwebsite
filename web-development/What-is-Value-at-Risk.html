									<ul class="list">
										<p>Value at Risk, in simplest term, is a statistic used to know how much loss our portfolio, company, positions will experience over a specific period of time. It can be denoted as VaR (Don't confuse it with VAR as capitalized A will mean variance). Now let's take an example:
										    1% one-year VaR $100 million means that there is a 1% chance that our portfolio will lose  $100 million in one year. As you noticed while writing VaR we write it like this: (% Chance)(Time period)(Amount that our potfolio might lose).

											<li>User</li>
											<li>Player</li>
											<li>Subscriber</li>
											<li>Any kind of return client</li>

										stops

											<h3 class="txtShadow">Churn Is Identified Based On Various Benchmarks Of
												Customer Disengagement
											</h3>
										</li>
										<p>Identifying churn and what is causing churn is important to take necessary
											preventive measure against churn.The way churn is defined can vary across
											businesses depending upon the type of business and revenue
											model.<br><br>
											<b>Churn could be
												a:</b>
										<ul class="mylist">
											<li>Customer not re-purchasing your products (within a stipulated time
												interval)</li>
											<li>Customer unsubscribing from the service</li>
											<li>Customer
												uninstalling
												an app</li>
										</ul>
										In general terms, churn can be defined as a degree of
										customer
										inactivity or disengagement observed over time.</p>
										<b>Various indicators convey that a business may be losing customers to churn,
											like:</b>
										<ul class="mylist">
											<li>low customer engagement</li>
											<li>lower customer usage activity</li>
											<li>Increasing customer
												complaints</li>
											<li>Low customer rating</li>
											<li>customer satisfaction</li>
										</ul>
										<p>Every business needs to create a set-off benchmarks based on which you can
											identify the customers who are at risk of churn.<br><br>Some other ways
											to
											identify
											customer churn are by actively collecting customer feedback and reviews
											to
											look
											for any possible customer dissatisfaction, checking with customer
											service
											&amp;
											support teams to understand any requirements of customers that the
											company is
											unable to meet.</p>


										<li class="subheadli">
											<h3 class="txtShadow">How Churn Rate Calculation Can Mislead Your Retention
												Strategy
											</h3>
										</li>
										<p>Basic Churn Rate for a time period calculated using the following
											formula:
										</p>
										<p><img loading="lazy" style="border: 1px solid black;"
												class="size-medium wp-image-4692 aligncenter"
												src="./images/Churn-rate-300x49.png"
												alt="Churn rate calculation formula for basic churn rate for a time period"
												width="300" height="49"
												srcset="https://www.perceptive-analytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Churn-rate-300x49.png 300w, https://www.perceptive-analytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Churn-rate.png 456w"
												sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
										<p>The above calculation though tends to give the initial figures to understand
											churn, it may not be the right calculation when we may have to keep
											track
											of
											churn rate for certain number of periods.</p>
										<b class="bmargin">Consider you are calculating churn for the month of April and
											May:</b>
										<ul class="mylist">
											<li>Let’s say, you started with 10,000 customers at the start of April and
												lost
												500
												of them (5 % of 10,000), gained 5000 new customers in April but lost 125
												of
												those new customers. Customers at the start of May is (10000-500) +
												(5000-125) =
												14375.</li>
											<li>Now in May let’s say you lost same rate of customers similar to April
												i.e.., 5% of 14375 = 719, gained 5000 new customers and lost 125 of
												them.</li>
										</ul>
										<p> Based on above formula Churn Rate in April is 6.25%.</p>

										<p><img loading="lazy" style="border: 1px solid black;"

												sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
										<p>Churn rate for month of May comes to be 5.87%</p>
										<p><img loading="lazy" style="border: 1px solid black;"

												sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
										<p>Though the churn is similar in both months as setup above, we see the
											churn
											rate
											dropped in May, this has nothing to do with improving churn performance
											or
											retention rate, rather a misreporting of the problem by the above
											formula.</p>
										<br>
										<li class="subheadli">
											<h3 class="txtShadow">Churn Calculation That Is Normalized For Company’s
												Growth & Size Is The Right Approach</h3>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Apart from that, if the month of April didn’t gain as many customers but only
										100, 2 of which churned and May remained same as above, then April would have
										Churn Rate of 5.02% and May would have Churn Rate of 6.3%. <br><br>This is
										because the
										<b>above calculation is highly influenced by number of new customers that joined
											during the period.</b><br><br> <b>It is important to have a churn
											calculation that better
											explains churn behavior that is normalized for growth and size of the
											company.</b>
										<br><br>This calculation will also tend to show wrong churn rates when
										calculated for
										different time ranges (Monthly, Quarterly, Annual, etc.,), and no. of. days in
										the month, like Feb 28 days and May 31 days are also likely to affect the churn
										rate calculation.

												<strong>Imbalance:</strong></a>
											<p>Imbalance is another important challenge that needs to

												of customer who have churned will always be significantly less than
												customers
												who have not churned (Ex: 1 in every 10 customers may

										<li>modelling on the sample data to get the insights.</li>
									</ul>
									Sampling needs
									to be
									done very carefully by making sure that the derived sample is a proper
									representation of population data. There is a chance that sample may miss out
									patterns related to certain segments of customers who are very prone to churn.
									</p>
									<p>During feature engineering &amp; training the machine learning model one has to
										make sure that the independent features passed on to the model training are
										not
										directly related to dependent feature. <br><br><b class="bmargin">For

										column
										‘IsChurn’ :
									<ul class="mylist">
										<li>1 for churn</li>
										<li>0 not churn</li>
									</ul>
									And some independent column ‘CustomerStatus’ :
									Active and Inactive., there is very good chance that all the inactive customers
									are churned customers.<br><br> In this case model will only predict churn only
									based
									‘CustomerStatus’ feature alone but nothing else, which will fail to give us
									actual understanding of what factors are contributing to churn.
									</p>
									<p><b>Once the model is trained and deployed to identify customers at risk of churn
											on
											real time basis, we need to maintain the trained model with latest data.</b>
										So, the
										model won’t miss out on any new emerging customer behavioral trends from the
										latest data, but learn and to predict more accurately for a long time.</p>

									<p>One way to improve your long-term churn is by asking your established customers
										to upgrade to better plans or editions. When there is constant product
										development with new capabilities and features, upgraded customers will get to
										experience core value of product once again.<br><br> You can also reintroduce
										your new
										features to some of the inactive accounts to help them know the value of your
										service better.</p>
									<p>By making necessary improvements at every stage of SaaS churn, you are helping
										customers to understand the true value of your product or service, which helps
										in generating more Revenue Per User and possibly net negative churn.</p>
									<p><b>Negative churn is when the amount of new revenue from your existing customers
											upgrades &amp; cross-sells is greater than the revenue that you lose from
											cancellations and downgrades.</b></p>

										<p>Banking sector is among the top 5 industries where we observe higher customer
											churn. Typically churn rate in banking would vary from 10% to
											30%.<br><br>
											Competitors
											would be main reason of customer churn in banking, customers tend to
											switch
											banks based on factors like better service, use of latest technology,
											reliability, Interest rates, service costs, location, customer satisfaction
											and
											various other benefits/services provided by bank. (Ex: Discounts on card
											transactions etc.,).<br><br> Studies show that identifying the customers
											who
											are
											at risk
											and reaching out to them at the right time can avoid as much as 11% of
											customer
											churn in banking sector.
										</p>
										<p>We can define customer churn in banking sector as one of the following,</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Customer who has closed the bank account.</li><br>
											<li>Customer who has not closed the account but didn’t make any sort of
												transactions for a specific time period.</li><br>

										</li>
										<p>Customer retention strategies typically involve two steps:
										<ul class="mylist">
											<li>Ranking customers based on their propensity to churn</li>
											<li>then offering retention incentives to a subset of customers who are at
												the
												top of ranking.</li>
										</ul> The implicit assumption is
										that this process would maximize firm&#8217;s profits by targeting customers who
										are most likely to churn. However, current marketing research and practice aims
										at maximizing the correct classification of churners and
										non-churners.<br><br>
										Profit
										from targeting a customer depends on:<br><br>
										<ul class="mylist">
											<li>
												a customer&#8217;s propensity to churn
											</li>
											<li>
												his/her spend or value, his/her probability of responding to
												retention offers, as well as the cost of these offers.
											</li>
										</ul>
										Overall profit of
										the
										firm also depends on the number of customers the firm decides to target for its
										retention campaign. proposes a binary classification based predictive model
										that
										identifies the right customers to target considering all the above-mentioned
										factors. <br><br>And then optimally create retention strategy which leads to, on
										average,
										a 115% improvement in profit compared to other methods.</p>

									<h2 id="c-index">Conclusion</h2>
									<p>From all this following conclusions can be made:</p>
									<ul class="myli">
										<li>
											<p>With immense digitization of businesses across the world consumers have
												access to
												several service providers. In such a competitive environment it takes a
												lot
												of
												effort &amp; resources to acquire new customers.</p>
										</li><br>
										<li>
											<p>
												Also cost to
												the
												customer for
												switching service provider are gradually decreasing which leads to
												higher churn
												rates.
											</p>
										</li><br>
										<li>
											<p>
												An effective churn analysis mechanism to identify the
												customers
												who are
												at risk of churn, understanding the reasons that are causing customer
												churn
												and
												adopting  a proactive customer retention strategies to prevent churn is
												very
												crucial to the performance of any business.
											</p>
										</li><br>
										<li>
											<p>
												We can predict churn by analyzing behavioral and transactional data of
												customers.
												Mining their data, to find patterns that are specific to customers who
												have
												already churned, can help you identify those customers, who are likely
												to churn.
											</p>
										</li><br>
										<li>
											<p>
												In order for a firm to increase the retention rate and reduce the churn
												rate,
												the firm has to focus on the customer satisfaction and making user
												interactions
												(transaction attributes), more user friendly and hassle free for its
												customers.
											</p>
										</li><br>
										<li>
											<p>
												Churn prediction can be used within your business. It is one of the key
												components, which in conjunction with lifetime value of customers (CLV)
												can help you take marketing decisions that is customized at a customer
												level.
											</p>
										</li><br>
										<li>
											<p>
												One can compare churn rates in different customer segments (high CLV
												segment and
												low CLV segment), and in turn we can take customized decisions to retain
												highly
												profitable customers and also not to spend more than required resources
												on
												retaining customers who are least profitable to the business.
